[Warning] [Performance] The grid blocking factor (16) is too small for reasonable performance. It should be 32 (or greater) when running on GPUs, and 16 (or greater) when running on CPUs.

[Warning] [Performance] The maximum grid size (64) is too small for reasonable performance. It should be 128 (or greater) when running on GPUs, and 64 (or greater) when running on CPUs.
